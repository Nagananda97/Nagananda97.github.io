									<h3>Classification of MATLAB mobile Acceleration sensor data into different activities.</h3>
									<p>Based on the Acceleration co-ordinate data we can try to classify the data into different activities like shaking, jumping and steady.. In this project we have used the MATLAB to label, train and test the dataset then we have merged all the dataset and used it as an input for the training models.</p>

									<h3>Automatic fault identification of microgrid using reinforcement learning model </h3>
									<p>The simple approach is to first denoise the signal and then pass the signal through the deep learning layers to obtain the result. The described model in the code will provide an accuracy of more than 85% for the noisy data and around 99% for noiseless data.</p>

									<h3>Non-Invasive Measurement Of Hemoglobin Content Using LabVIEW</h3>
									<p>Monitoring of Heamoglobin using a  Photo-Plethysmo-Graphic(PPG) signal obtained from finger by using two monochromatic light at 660nm (Red) and 940nm (IR) to measure haemoglobin non-invasively. An empirical equation for the calculation of haemoglobin content in blood is used here with well-known extinction coefficient of haemoglobin. Non-invasive method is much more interesting by its evident advantages such as real time monitoring. The haemoglobin is measured non-invasively. This investigation helps to rule out the diseases like anaemia(low Hb level)</p>
